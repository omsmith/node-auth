This repository is configured with [EditorConfig][EditorConfig] and
[ESLint][ESLint] rules.

## Release

When it comes time do a release, update the versions of each package and commit
and tag the changes. A script is available to do this for you:

```sh
./bin/set-version-and-commit.sh 4.1.7
```

Push the version update and tag to GitHub and travis-ci will take care of
publishing the release:

```sh
git push upstream master v4.1.7
```
